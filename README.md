In this project, we discuss the results of the proposed architecture for group learning at the level of sub-networks of a model
used data set are : 1- cifar-10 2- cifar-100 3- MNIST and 4- fashion-MNIST
base model in this code is resnet50
each folder contain models and result of execution for 100 epoch
folder 0-resnet is base model and result for 100 epoch
folder 1-EnsembleLearning contain 3 ensemble model : output ensemble of 2 base model and other ensemble of subnetwork 2 samae model named :ensemble layer and ensemble neurun
The compair file is created to compare the results of different executions
